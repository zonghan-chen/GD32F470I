## 04_USART_Printf

1. The data receiving area of the serial port debugging tool displays "USART printf example: please press the Tamper key".
1. After pressing the Tamper Key, the data receiving area of the serial port debugging tool displays "USART printf example" (repeatable operation).



## 05_USART_Echo_Interrupt_Mode

2. The data receiving area of the serial port debugging tool displays the data in the tx_buffer array.
3. Send the data in data.txt to the rx_buffer array through the data sending area of the serial port debugging tool.
4. If the data in tx_buffer array and rx_buffer array are the same, all the LEDs will light up successively and then turn off simultaneously (loop execution).
5. Else if the data in tx_buffer array and rx_buffer array are different, all the LEDs will flash three times (loop execution).



## 07_ADC_Temperature_Vrefint

1. The data receiving area of the serial port debugging tool displays the temperature, internal reference voltage and external battery voltage values every two seconds.

(Loop execution)



**Formula:**

- Temperature:
  
  $Temperature(^\circ\text{C})=\frac{V_{25^\circ\text{C}}-V_{sensor}}{AvgSlope}+25$
